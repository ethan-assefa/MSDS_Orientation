## Editing a README Markdown Doc
There are a number of important things to understand when formatting a Markdown document.

Headers are set with a "#" or hashtag

### This is an example header

You can edit text with "*" to make text italics or "**" to make it bold

*This part is italic* but from **here on it is bold**

> Important things should probably recieve a quotation with the ">" symbol
